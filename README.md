## SOLID Principles in Practice

This repository demonstrates practical applications of each of the SOLID principles in software design. It is structured to provide a clear before-and-after comparison for each principle, showcasing the improvements and enhancements achieved through their implementation.

### Principles Covered:

- **SRP (Single Responsibility Principle):** 
  Ensuring a class has only one reason to change by focusing on a single responsibility.
  
- **OCP (Open/Closed Principle):** 
  Designing modules that are open for extension but closed for modification, enabling easier scalability.
  
- **LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle):** 
  Guaranteeing that objects of a superclass can be replaced with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
  
- **ISP (Interface Segregation Principle):** 
  Splitting a large interface into smaller, more specific ones so that implementing classes only need to be concerned with the methods that are of interest to them.
  
- **DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle):** 
  Decoupling high-level modules from low-level modules by relying on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.

### Repository Structure:

Each SOLID principle is represented by its own directory. Within each directory, you will find:

- **Before:** The initial application setup, prior to applying the SOLID principle.
- **After:** The refactored application, demonstrating the enhanced design after applying the SOLID principle.
